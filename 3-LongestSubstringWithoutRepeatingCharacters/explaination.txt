🧠 Pattern Used Here
👉 Sliding Window Pattern
Why Sliding Window?

The problem asks for:

Longest substring

Without repeating characters

Substring = continuous

We need to expand and shrink a window efficiently

How Sliding Window works here:

right pointer → expands the window

left pointer → shrinks the window when duplicates appear

char_set → keeps track of characters inside the window

Window always contains unique characters
