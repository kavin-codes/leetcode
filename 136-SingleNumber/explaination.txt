# Pattern: Bit Manipulation (XOR Pattern)
# Idea:
# 1. XOR of a number with itself is 0  -> a ^ a = 0
# 2. XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself -> a ^ 0 = a
# 3. XOR is commutative and associative
# So, duplicate numbers cancel each other.
# Only the single number remains at the end.

class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        result = 0  # Initialize result to 0
        
        # Iterate through each number in the list
        for num in nums:
            # XOR current number with result
            # Duplicate numbers cancel out
            result ^= num
        
        # Final result will be the number that appears once
        return result


# Input list
nums = [2, 2, 1]

# Create object of Solution class
S1 = Solution()

# Call the method and print result
print(S1.singleNumber(nums))
