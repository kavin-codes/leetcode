# LeetCode 205 - Isomorphic Strings
# We check if two strings s and t are isomorphic.
# Isomorphic means:
# 1. Each character in s maps to exactly one character in t.
# 2. No two different characters in s map to the same character in t.

class Solution:
    def isIsomorphic(self, s, t):
        # Dictionary to store mapping from s -> t
        map_s_t = {}
        
        # Dictionary to store mapping from t -> s
        # This ensures no two characters in s map to same character in t
        map_t_s = {}
        
        # Loop through both strings together
        for c1, c2 in zip(s, t):
            
            # Check mapping from s to t
            if c1 in map_s_t:
                # If already mapped, check if mapping is correct
                if map_s_t[c1] != c2:
                    return False
            else:
                # Create new mapping
                map_s_t[c1] = c2
            
            # Check mapping from t to s
            if c2 in map_t_s:
                # If already mapped, check if mapping is correct
                if map_t_s[c2] != c1:
                    return False
            else:
                # Create new reverse mapping
                map_t_s[c2] = c1
        
        # If no conflicts found, strings are isomorphic
        return True


# Test the function
s = "egg"
t = "add"

s1 = Solution()
print(s1.isIsomorphic(s, t))  # Output: True
