strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]   # Input list of strings

class Solution:

            freq = {}       # Dictionary to store frequency of characters in word

            for ch in word: # Loop through each character in the word
                if ch in freq:
                    freq[ch] += 1   # Increase count if character already exists
                else:

            # Convert freq dictionary into a sortable & hashable key

            # Add the current word to its anagram group
            res[key].append(word)

        # Return only the grouped anagrams (dictionary values)
        return list(res.values())


s1 = Solution()                 # Create object of Solution class
print(s1.single(strs))          # Call function and print grouped anagrams


output:

[['eat', 'tea', 'ate'], ['tan', 'nat'], ['bat']]

Patterns / Techniques Used in This Code

HashMap (Dictionary) Pattern

Uses dictionaries (res, freq) to store data in key–value format.

Helps in fast lookup and grouping.

Very common in LeetCode problems.

Frequency Counting Pattern

Counts how many times each character appears in a word.

Example: "eat" → {'e': 1, 'a': 1, 't': 1}

Canonical Key / Normalization Pattern

Converts character frequency into a fixed, comparable form using
tuple(sorted(freq.items())).

Ensures all anagrams generate the same key even if order differs.

Grouping Pattern

Words with the same key are grouped together in a list.

Implemented using res[key].append(word).

Dictionary + List Combination

Dictionary stores groups.

Lists store multiple words belonging to the same group.
